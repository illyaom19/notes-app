# AGENTS.md

## Agent Landing Brief

This repository uses `docs/` as the canonical location for project documentation.

Read in this order before making changes:
1. `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
2. `docs/SPRINTS_SUMMARY.md`
3. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`

## Mandatory Documentation Rule

Every agent must keep `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` up to date.

Update `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` at these moments:
1. After planning decisions are finalized
2. After code or docs changes
3. After tests or verification commands
4. Before handoff/completion

## Documentation Constraints

- Do not leave undocumented decisions, blockers, or scope changes.
- Do not add new root markdown files (root `AGENTS.md` is the exception).
- Add all new project markdown docs under `docs/`.
- Keep updates factual and concise, with concrete file paths and command outcomes.
