# Sprint 0 — Foundations

## Agent Role
You are a senior systems architect and frontend performance engineer.

## Goal
Establish the technical foundation of a modular, widget-based, high-performance note-taking app.

## Hard Rules
- Everything must be modular
- Widgets must be dynamically loaded
- No heavy code at app start

## Tasks
1. Choose a web-first stack supporting dynamic imports and Web Workers.
2. Define the Widget Base Interface (lifecycle, rendering modes).
3. Implement a dynamic widget loader/registry.
4. Implement global canvas + camera (pan/zoom).
5. Ensure app boots instantly with no widgets.

## Deliverables
- Project skeleton
- Widget base interface
- Dynamic module loader
- Canvas with pan/zoom

## Exit Criteria
- Dummy widget loads only when instantiated
- Smooth pan/zoom
