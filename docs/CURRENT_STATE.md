# CURRENT_STATE

## Current Sprint
- Pre-implementation setup and documentation governance complete.
- Sprint execution has not started yet.

## What Exists Today
- Root landing brief for agents: `AGENTS.md`
- Project requirements and sprint briefs in `docs/`
- Git repository initialized and published to `origin/main`

## In Progress
- No active coding sprint work in progress.

## Blockers
- None at this time.

## Decisions Made
- Root instruction file is `AGENTS.md`.
- All project markdown docs are stored under `docs/`.
- Canonical handoff/status file is `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` and must be updated by every agent.

## Next Actions
1. Start Sprint 0 implementation using `docs/SPRINT_0_Foundations.md`.
2. Keep widget architecture modular with dynamic loading from day one.
3. Update this file after each implementation and verification step.

## Verification Status
- Repository docs layout migrated to `docs/`.
- Root governance file created at `AGENTS.md`.
- Initial current-state baseline documented.
