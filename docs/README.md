# Docs Index

This project now keeps **4 live docs** at the root of `docs/`.

## Live (Canonical)
- `docs/README.md` (this file)
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/MISSING_FROM_VISION.md`

## Archived
- Historical sprint and design docs are archived in `docs/done/`.
- Nothing in `docs/done/` is treated as live implementation truth.

## Maintenance Rules
- Update `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` after major planning, implementation, and verification runs.
- Keep `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` aligned with current product direction.
- Keep `docs/MISSING_FROM_VISION.md` limited to real, still-missing gaps.
