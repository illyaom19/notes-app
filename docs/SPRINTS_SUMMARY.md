# SPRINTS_SUMMARY

## Active Sprint Series

This is the active roadmap after archiving prior sprint docs to `docs/done/`.

Order:
Sprint 8 -> Sprint 9 -> Sprint 10 -> Sprint 11 -> Sprint 12 -> Sprint 13 -> Sprint 14 -> Sprint 15 -> Sprint 16 -> Sprint 17 -> Sprint 18

## Rules

1. Complete each sprint fully before starting the next.
2. Do not preload modules for future sprints.
3. Keep all features behind lazy boundaries.
4. Preserve tablet and stylus responsiveness at every step.
5. Update `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` after planning, implementation, and verification.

## Definition of Done (Per Sprint)

- Sprint exit criteria are met.
- Tests listed in sprint spec pass.
- No regression in baseline flows (ink, pdf, popups, whitespace, graph).
- Documentation is updated (`CURRENT_STATE` + affected sprint docs).
