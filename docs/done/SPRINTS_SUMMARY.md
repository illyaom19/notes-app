# SPRINTS_SUMMARY.md

## How to Run These Sprints

1. Each sprint is isolated and must be completed fully before starting the next.
2. Do NOT preload future sprint features.
3. Every sprint must result in a runnable, testable artifact.
4. Performance and modularity take priority over features.
5. If a sprint introduces lag, stop and refactor.

## Order
Sprint 0 → Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 → Sprint 4 → Sprint 5 → Sprint 6 → Sprint 7

## Rules for Agents
- Never assume future features.
- Load code dynamically.
- Prefer snapshots over live rendering.
- Measure performance constantly.

## Definition of Done
- Exit criteria met
- No regressions
- No unnecessary code loaded
